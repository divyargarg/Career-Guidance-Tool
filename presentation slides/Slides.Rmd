#Good Design Aspects
- The <b>geographical representation</b> of makes it easier to map states, can help in analyzing <b>cost region wise.</b>
- It is using color scheme to indicate light colors as low cost and dark color for high tuition cost.<b>(Chloropeth mapping)
As mentioned in Wilke  Ch.15</b>

---
#Ways to Improve 
- Color scheme is not suitable for <b>color blind</b>.(Ogabe-Ito color scheme to be aware of color blindness as cited in Wilke Ch. 19”)
- There are <b>missing labels</b> on the plot to map states.
- Tuition cost should be <b>binned in ranges</b>.While continuous color scales tend to look visually appealing, they can be difficult to read.<b>(Ch 15 Wilke)</b> 
- It would be nice to see actual<b> fee/cost value as it changes</b> on the same graph.
- Comparing the cost across states for the given years is difficult in this report. <b> This won't tell us the order or rank of states based on tuition cost. </b>
- This won't give us the <b>true trend of cost</b> for any states over these given years.

#Good Design Aspects
- Easier to <b>compare trends</b> between intresting states.
- Can <b>Visualize trends</b> of all the years. 
---
#Ways to Improve
-  Color scheme is not suitable for <b>color blind</b>.(Ogabe-Ito color scheme to be aware of color blindness as cited in Wilke Ch. 19”)
- There are only few states, cannot <b>compare the costs</b> between all the states.

# What we aim to do using shiny

---
#Nice to have 
- <b>Rank/order of states</b> based on cost per year  - easy comparison.
- We are dealing with geospatial data so <b>map representation</b> will be good.
- Options to filter data based on states or regions - pick only the ones which we are interested in.
- We have data spread across 12 years, so a trend line report will be good for <b>analysing the change of cost over these years.</b>
- Ideal solution will be an <b>interactive shiny dashboard</b> including all the above reports which will help answer all questions in one view
